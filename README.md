- **ReactJS**
- **Langchain**
- **Python and Flask**
- **BART Model**
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo Model**

## Implementation Details
The implementation leverages the OpenAI API integrated with the LangChain framework to provide responses from documents, which are converted into text format and segmented into manageable fragments. These fragments are stored in a vectorized database using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector storage and retrieval. Natural language processing techniques identify leave periods and generate document summaries.

## Additional Notes
- **Privacy and Access Management:** The application manages access to information through custom role-based permissions. If users do not have the necessary access, the application provides details about the contacts if they are included in the documents.
- **Efficient Information Browsing:** The application's document summarization feature facilitates the quick identification of relevant information, enhancing usability and efficiency.
